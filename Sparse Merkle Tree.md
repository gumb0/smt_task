## Sparse Merkle Trees

### Introduction

A Sparse Merkle Tree (SMT) is a [full binary] Merkle tree that contains a _leaf_ 
for every possible output of a hash function.
For a hash function with N-bit output the SMT:
 - height: _h = N_,
 - number of leaves: _l = 2<sup>N</sup>_,
 - number of all nodes: _n = 2<sup>N + 1</sup> - 1_.
 
For example when using any 256-bit hash function the corresponding SMT has
2^256 leaves.

(TODO: The following paragraph must be improved)
Each tree level (nodes of the same height) corresponds to the bit of the hash 
value, going down the tree corresponds to going from the most significant bit 
to the least significant bit, choosing left or right child depending on the bit 
value.


### Implementation

Since the full in-memory representation of an SMT is impractical 
(to say the least), we have to simulate it. 
The simulation is practical because the tree is sparse: most leaves are empty
and the hashes of empty leaves are the same. 
Similarly, the hashes of _internal_ nodes whose all children are empty are 
the same.

This means that only the hashes for the `k` Merkle branches need to be computed,
where `k` is the number of keys (TODO: should the key be explained?) stored in the tree.

If we don't store any special values in the tree associated with each key (that is, we want to represent a "set" of values, similar to `std::set`), it is natural to keep at the leaves of the tree the values 0 and 1.

### Default hashes

It is valuable to pre-compute a set of _default hashes_ for all `h` levels:

- At level 0, the default hash is `H("")`
- At level 1, the default hash is `H(H("") || H(""))`
- At level 2, the default hash is `H(H(H("") || H("")) || H(H("") || H("")))`
... and so on,
where `H` is the hash function returning the result hash as an array of bytes, 
`""` is 0-length array of bytes and `||` represents bytes concatenation.

(TODO: Should we numerate the default hashes as D0, D1, etc?)

In a sparse tree almost all leaves (level 0 nodes) have the value `H("")`, 
almost all level 1 nodes have the value `H(H("") || H(""))`, 
almost all level 2 nodes have the value `H(H(H("") || H("")) || H(H("") || H("")))`,
and so on. Only the nodes that lead to a non-zero leaf value actually need to be 
computed individually - the rest have the same value and we can compute them 
efficiently.

### Example 1

Here's an illustration of the simplified SMT storing 4-bit values. 
Here to store the keys `5` and `C` we only need to compute the hashes 
corresponding to white circles, all grey circles are default hashes and 
should not be duplicated in the storage.

## Sparse Merkle Proofs

Unlike a proof in an usual Merkle Tree, proofs in SMT are **not** `h` N-bit 
hashes going all the way from level 0 at the leaf all the way to the root! 

Instead, a proof has a format `(proof_bits, array_of_hashes)`, 
where  `proof_bits`  is `h` bits that can compactly represent whether the sisters (TODO: what?)
going up to the root are default hashes or not â€“ that is, for each bit:

- 0 means "use the default hash of corresponding level"
- 1 means "use the corresponding hash from the `array_of_hashes`"

(TODO: The above can be improved by introducing the notion of _i-th_ bit in `proof_bits`).

The `array_of_hashes` contains just the non-default hashes. The last element in 
the array is always the tree root hash.

### Example 2

For the tree illustrated above:

- `default_hash0 = H("")`
- `default_hash1 = H(default_hash0 || default_hash0)`
- `default_hash2 = H(default_hash1 || default_hash1)`
- `H2 = H(default_hash0 || H(1))`
- `H1 = H(default_hash2 || H(H2 || default_hash1))`
- The proof of existence of the key `5` : `(0b0001, H3, Hroot)`
- The proof of existence of the key `C` : `(0b0001, H1, Hroot)`
- The proof of non-existence of the key `6` : `(0b0101, H2, H3, Hroot)`
